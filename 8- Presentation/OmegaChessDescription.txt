Omega chess is a variant of the classic board game chess. This version is played on a larger chess board with two new pieces, the champion and the wizard. Besides that pawns can move three spaces on their first turn, these are the only new rules added to the game. The wizard and champion both "jump" over pieces in thier moves, like the knight. The champion is like a small queen with the ability to move forwards, backwards, and diagonally, but only up to two spaces away. The wizard is almost like a more powerful knight with longer L-shaped jumps or single diagonal space movements. With a larger board plus new pieces at their command, two players can command armies to do battle in the game of kings unlike ever before!
