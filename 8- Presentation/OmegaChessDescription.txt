Omega chess is a variant of the classic board game chess. This version is played on a larger 10x10 plus 4 corner squares chess board with two new pieces, the champion and the wizard. Besides that pawns can move three spaces on their first turn, these are the only new rules added to the game. So, checkmate is still the goal. The wizard and champion both "jump" over pieces in their moves, like the knight. The champion is like a small queen with the ability to move forwards, backwards, laterally, and diagonally, but only up to two spaces away, and only two spaces away diagonally. The wizard is almost like a more powerful knight with longer L-shaped jumps of three spaces in a cardinal direction and one over, or in single space diagonal movements. With a larger board plus 2 of each of the new pieces at their command, two players can command armies to do battle in the game of kings unlike ever before!
