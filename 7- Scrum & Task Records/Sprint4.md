- None. 


## Retrospective

#### What went well
- Communication improved a lot. 
- Work was done over break. 
- We asked each other for help much more often. 
- We tended to split into teams of 2 between frontend and backend, and the focus helped progress. 

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
- There could/should have been more technical planning, as with setting up database tables. 
- Things like the class diagram could have been done earlier. 
- Letting PRs pile up at some point. 
- We had a week less than we thought, so the Sprint was extended. 
- We were able to adapt from a plan earlier in the semester that was insufficient and didn't really apply.
