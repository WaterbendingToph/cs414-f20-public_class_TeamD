## Review
- For this sprint, we focused on completing our project setup by creating our template classes and the database. We began work on registration, matchmaking, gameplay, and login by creating the basic frontend and backend framework for these epics.

## Retrospective

#### What went well
- We have a pretty good system in place for reviewing code submissions through PRs, which has helped prevent any code issues in our master branch. We've also communicated well through a sprint that had a lot of out-of-class interruptions that made it difficult to complete as much work as we wanted.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
- We had a few teammembers with out-of-class issues that prevented us from accomplishing as much work as expected. We also ran into some issues with building our front/backend on different machines. We were able to work through these issues by discovering the files that were conflicting across our different operating systems and removing them from our repository.
