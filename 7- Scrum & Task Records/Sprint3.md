## Retrospective

#### What went well
We are able to communicate with everyone and are able to get our tasks done in time instead of sitting on a task for too long. We were able to plan our tasks so that we don't have any conflicting work with other people, meaning we were able to get our work done faster.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
Some of our team members had some emergencies, like family emergencies and the fires near Cameron Peak, that came up unexpectedly so they had to stop working for some time to attend those emergencies. We had to replan our work and tasks that needed to be completed and work accordingly.
